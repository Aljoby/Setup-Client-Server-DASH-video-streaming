# Setup-Client-Server-DASH-video-streaming

Steps to setup a DASH client in a Docker Container for downloading video segments from DASH server. 

First: Setup DASH client in a Docker Container

1- Install docker engine into your machine

sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
sudo apt-cache policy docker-ce


2- download dashClientImage docker image from the docker hub

docker pull aljoby/selenium_docker_new:dashClientImage

3- After pulling the image, you can check it out in your machine with this command: docker images, then you should see

aljoby/selenium_docker_new   dashClientImage     9f16ef5e64e6        2 months ago        1.25GB


4- Before you run an instance of docker image (i.e, container), recall you have to specify data to be used by the container and to get the data generated by it, hence "mount volume" technique managed by docker can do that, so use flag -v to mount a directory in the host machine to a container. Example, use -v /home/waleed/test/containers/container-data1:/usr/src/app, where is host directory /home/waleed/test/containers/container-data1 and /usr/src/app is default contain directory. This dashClient needs an input of DASH server URL, client's virtual dispaly, type of bowser, and others of interest. This is stored in a file "example.py". On the other hand, the output information of the dashClient such as logs about streaming stored in the host under directory "chrome_user_dir_real". Thus, in the host directory /home/waleed/test/containers/container-data1 the input "example.py" should be available to read from, and output empty output directory "chrome_user_dir_real" should be available to write to.
 
5- Run the docker image 

sudo docker run --privileged -p 4000:4000 -v /home/waleed/test/containers/container-data1:/usr/src/app -t aljoby/selenium_docker_new



Second: Setup DASH server

Finally: Start video streaming between the client and the server
